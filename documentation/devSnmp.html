<h2 id="Introduction"><u>Introduction & Acknowledgments</u></h2>

<p>This module provides EPICS device-layer support for hardware devices
that communicate via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). Its
development was primarily focused on Wiener ISEG/MPOD power supply
crates, but it should work just as well with any SNMP-aware devices the
user can obtain MIB definition files for.</p>

<p>Other SNMP device-support modules exist for EPICS. This module was
originally based on the SNMP support module by Richard Dabney (formerly
of LANL) and later Albert Kagarmanov of DESY, which can be found
<A HREF="http://www-mks2.desy.de/content/e4/e40/e41/e12212/index_ger.html">here</A>.
At the time (~2006) this module did not support setting but only reading
and this was the impetus for NSCL to develop its own EPICS device
support module based loosely on the DESY code. Another EPICS SNMP device
support module developed by Sheng Peng, which also adds setting support,
is available
<A HREF="http://controls.diamond.ac.uk/downloads/other/files/">here</A>.</p>

<h2 id="Requirements"><u>Requirements</u></h2>
<p>
<h4 id="NETSNMP">NET-SNMP</h4>
<p>This module uses to the net-snmp library for access to SNMP-based
devices. The home web page for this library is
<A HREF="http://www.net-snmp.org/">here</A>.
NET-SNMP also includes a number of useful utilities such as snmpget and
snmpset for reading and writing SNMP variables, and snmpwalk for
listing what variables a host makes available.</p>

<p>NET-SNMP source code and binaries are available for a number of
platforms, including Linux and Windows. This module has only been tested
on Linux thus far, but in theory it should work on any platform EPICS
and the NET-SNMP source code can be compiled for.</p>

<h4 id="MIBfiles">MIB files for SNMP target devices</h4>

<p>SNMP variables within devices are referenced by their object ID (or
&quotOID&quot). In their raw form these appear to a human as a long and
bewildering string of numbers and dots. In order to refer to these in
more human-readable terms, MIB (Management Information Base) files
provide a translation into text identifiers (which are also long, in
fact longer, but are usually not as bewildering).</p>

<p>MIB files need to be copied to a directory where NET-SNMP can find
them. On a Linux system this is typically /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/ or
/usr/share/mibs/.  A colon-separated list of directories can be added
to the search path by adding a command such as
     <pre>epicsEnvSet("MIBDIRS", "+$(TOP)/mibs:/some/other/directory")</pre>
to the startup command file.  The leading '+' character indicates the the following
directory, or list of directories, is to be added to the default list and
not to replace it.</p>

<p>MIB files can often be obtained from the manufacturer of the device,
typically on the software and documentation CD shipped with it, or can be
downloaded from the manufacturer's support web pages. A MIB file for
Wiener/ISEG/MPOD systems, the focus of this module, can be found in the
'mibs' subdirectory of the distribution.<p>

<h2 id="Usage"><u>Usage</u></h2>

<h3 id="RecordTypes">Supported record types</h3>

The following EPICS record types are supported:
<dl>
  <dt>Input</dt>
    <dd>ai</dd>
    <dd>longin</dd>
    <dd>stringin</dd>
    <dd>waveform (DBF_STRING, DBF_CHAR, DBF_UCHAR)</dd>
  <dt>Output
    <dd>ao</dd>
    <dd>longout</dd>
    <dd>stringout</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="RecordSpec">Record specification</h3>

For demonstration purposes an example input and output record are listed below:
<pre>
   record(ai, "$(DEV):VoltageRead")
   {
     field(DESC, "SNMP channel")
     field(DTYP, "Snmp")
     field(SCAN, ".2 second")
     field(PREC, "3")
     field(INP, "@$(HOST) guru WIENER-CRATE-MIB::outputMeasurementSenseVoltage.$(CHAN) Float: 100")
   }

   record(ao, "$(DEV):VoltageSet")
   {
     field(DESC, "SNMP channel")
     field(DTYP, "Snmp")
     field(SCAN, "Passive")
     field(PREC, "3")
     field(OUT, "@$(HOST) guru WIENER-CRATE-MIB::outputVoltage.$(CHAN) Float: 100 F")
   }
</pre>

The format of the INP/OUT fields is:
<pre>   @host community OIDname mask dataLength [set_type[special_flags]]</pre>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
  <tr><td>host</td>
      <td><p>The SNMP host device to communicate with, either an
          IP address or a node name that the IOC's DNS server can
          resolve.</p>
      </td>
  <tr>
  <tr><td>community</td>
      <td><p>The SNMP community name to use when accessing the desired
          variable. SNMP hosts often have multiple communities, a
          read-only community (generally named 'public') and a separate
          read-write community (in the case of Wiener/ISEG/MPODs this
          defaults to 'guru').</p>
          <p>Note that we use the same community for both the voltage
          read and the voltage write PVs above, this allows the module
          to pack requests to read both OIDs into the same SNMP poll request
          whenever possible rather than having to issue two separate
          poll requests.</p>
      </td>
  <tr><td>OIDname</td>
      <td><p>The name of the SNMP variable to either read or set. A list
          of the variables an SNMP host makes available can be retrieved
          with the NET-SNMP snmpwalk utility.</p>
      </td>
  <tr><td>mask</td>
      <td><p>The substring in the returned variable value string that
          proceeds the value we actually wish to obtain. For example
          the SNMP host may return this text for the value of the
          floating-point variable we're reading:</p>
          <pre>   Opaque: Float: 349.9885 V</pre>
          <p>The mask in our example PVs above specifies that our
          variable value follows the text 'Float:'. </p>
          <p>Underscores can be used as wildcards in a mask string, and
          will match any character including a space. The mask
          'Opaque:_Float:' would work in the above example.</p>
      </td>
  <tr><td>dataLength</td>
      <td><p>How many bytes of buffer should be allocated to hold the reply
          string from the SNMP host for the given variable. 100 bytes as
          used in the example is generally more than adequate. If the data length
          size specified is too small the returned string will be
          truncated to fit in the buffer space specified.</p>
      </td>
  <tr><td>set_type</td>
      <td><p><u>Required</u> for output records, and required for input
          records if they need any special flags to be defined (see
          below). Set type is a single character specifying what data
          type to use in setting the SNMP variable.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>'s' for string</li>
          <li>'i' for integer</li>
          <li>'F' for floating-point</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that 's' and 'i' are lowercase and 'F' is uppercase.
          These are the same type specifiers used by the NET-SNMP
          snmpset utility.</p>
      </td>
  <tr><td>special_flags</td>
      <td><p>Optional/experimental.  In the future this will be a place
          to specify any configuration flags that might be needed to
          parse the return string for the given variable. At present a
          few flags are defined for testing and exploratory
          purposes:</p>
          <ul>
    <li>'p' squeezes all whitespace out of the returned string</li>
    <li>'h' signals parsing hex-encoded bytes separated by spaces, '01 4e 7f' for example</li>
    <li>'r' signals that the bit order of an integer should be inverted (host device annoyingly returns it as LSB...MSB)</li>
          </ul>
    <p>The last two are useful for parsing BITS variables from
       Wiener/ISEG/MPODs. A better solution for these devices would be
       to enable the &quotreturn BITS as INTEGER&quot option via the USB
       configuration utility, but that's getting beyond our scope here.</p>

<h3 id="Using">Adding this support module to an application</h3>
In addition to the EPICS standard procedure of adding devSnmp.dbd to <i>appName</i>_DBD and
devSnmp to <i>appName</i>_LIBS in the application Makefile the following three lines
must be added to the Makefile following the initial include statement:
<pre>
USR_CFLAGS += `net-snmp-config --cflags`
USR_LDFLAGS += `net-snmp-config --libs`
PROD_LDLIBS += `net-snmp-config --libs`
</pre>

<h3 id="IocshCmds">IOC shell commands</h3>

<p>A number of IOC shell commands are provided to configure module
   parameters and help diagnose problems, these are detailed below.</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="devSnmpSetDebug"><b>devSnmpSetDebug(level)</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Deprecated, devSnmpSetParam with DebugLevel parameter should be
  used instead. Provided for compatibility with earlier versions of the
  SNMP device support module.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="devSnmpSetParam"><b>devSnmpSetParam(parameter,value)</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Sets a given module paramater, identified by a text string, to the
  given integer value. Invoking this function without any arguments
  displays the current values of all configurable parameters.</p>
  <p>Unless specifically noted in their description, parameters can be
     changed at any time.</p>
  <p>The following parameters are provided:</p>

          made generous to overcome issues observed with older
          Wiener/ISEG/MPOD firmware, where replies sporadically arrive
          with requested OIDs missing and other OIDs returned in their
          place. This is detailed further in the <a href="#gotcha_DiffVar">'gotchas'</a>

          are most in need of being polled, so that high scan-rate items
          are polled more often than low scan-rate ones. When a poll is
          being assembled the determination of which items to poll is
          based on a calculated &quotpoll weight&quot, that being the number of
          milliseconds before a given item is due to be polled. A
          negative weight indicates that a poll of the item is overdue,
          a positive one that it is not yet due (but will be in
          pollWeight milliseconds).</p>
          <p>MaxTopPollWeight is the weight that the most-poll-needy
          item must be at or below for a poll to be generated on the
          current loop of the module's 'send' thread. If no item meets
          this threshold no poll will be assembled and sent during this
          loop &#8211 there is nothing the module sees the need to poll and
          so it doesn't waste bandwidth doing so. If the most-needy item
          is at or below this level, then a poll will be generated for
          the most-needy item and for the not-quite-as-needy items
          following it, until either the poll request is full or an item

          prevent annoying value flicker when a setting is made by the

          saved values, we still want polls to occur and not be

  </dd>

  <dt id="devSnmpSetMaxOidsPerReq"><br><b>devSnmpSetMaxOidsPerReq(hostname,maxoids)</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Sets the maximum number of OIDs that a given SNMP host device can
     accept in a read request. The default is 32. Wiener/ISEG/MPOD hosts
     can handle 50.

  <p>Increasing this limit for a host can increase polling efficiency,
     but some devices (see the <a href="#gotcha_FewerVar">'gotchas'</a>
     section) are known to return no error when their maximum OID query
     limit is exceeded &#8211 they simply return only the number
     variables they can accept. The module code does a sanity-check on
     returned variable lists and prints a warning message should this
     occur.</p>

    <p>This function can be called anywhere in IOC startup, either
       before or after iocInit() or interactively while the IOC is
       running.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="epicsSnmpInit"><b>epicsSnmpInit</b></dt>

  </dd>

  <dt id="devSnmpSetSnmpVersion"><b>devSnmpSetSnmpVersion(hostname,snmpVersionString)</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Sets the SNMP version to use in communicating with a given SNMP
     host. The following versions are supported:<p>
  <pre>
    SNMP_VERSION_1
    SNMP_VERSION_2c
    SNMP_VERSION_3</pre>
  <p>The default is SNMP_VERSION_2c. SNMP host behavior is unpredictable
     if the version set is higher than it supports.</p>
  <p>This function should be called in IOC startup scripts <u>before</u>
     any record definitions referencing the given host are loaded.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="snmpr"><b>snmpr(level,match)</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Outputs a report with the given level of detail. Currently levels
     0..2 are supported. This command also initiates a brief 2-second
     sanity test of the module's two threads, 'read' and 'send', to
     verify that their loop counters are still incrementing and thus
     have not exited or hung up.</p>
  <p>If 'match' is specified then only the hosts, groups and PVs/OIDs
     which have a PV or OID containing the given text will be displayed.</p>

  <dt id="snmpz"><b>snmpz</b></dt>

</dl>

<h2 id="Gotchas"><u>'Gotchas'</u></h2>

<p>This section collects problematic issues discovered either in using this module or in communicating with certain SNMP target devices. It is by no means necessarily complete, it contains only those issues we have encountered thus far ourselves or have heard reliable reports of from others. Reports of issues encountered by others are of course always welcome.</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="gotcha_FieldLen"><b>INP/OUT fields exceeding the maximum field length EPICS allows</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>SNMP OID strings can be LONG. The maximum field length EPICS will
     tolerate, however, is 80 characters as of R3.14.12.2 and INP/OUT
     fields with long OID names can easily exceed this limit. The device support
     itself expands strings such as %(FOO) or %{FOO} to the value of the FOO
     environment variable so this can be used (%(W) for WIENER-CRATE-MIB::
     for example) to work around this limit.  Note that expansion of macros
     of the form $(M) or ${M} will not work since these are expaneded too
     early and the resulting string will still not fit into 80 characters.
     Another option is simply
     patching EPICS base code with a larger field length limit and
     recompiling base. This patch can be made in dbStaticLib.c in
     routine dbPutString()'s handling of DBF_INLINK/DBF_OUTLINK fields.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="gotcha_FewerVar"><b>Devices that quietly return fewer variables than requested</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Some varieties of MOXA single-port terminal servers have been
     observed to do this, rather than return an error when too many
     variables are requested they simply return the number they can
     support with no error of any kind flagged. The module code protects
     itself against this by sanity-checking the number of variables
     returned against the number it requested when a reply to a poll is
     received. To avoid this issue the <a href="#devSnmpSetMaxOidsPerReq">devSnmpSetMaxOidsPerReq</a> IOC shell
     call can be used to limit how many variables a given host will be
     asked for per request, adjust the number downwards until the module
     stops issuing warnings.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="gotcha_DiffVar"><b>Devices the return different variables than the ones requested</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Some Wiener/ISEG/MPOD units have been observed to do this,
     especially when the crate has a higher number of cards and more
     channels are being polled. The module protects itself against this
     by comparing the OIDs of the variables returned with the OIDs that
     were requested. Brief bouts of mismatches are tolerated to avoid
     endless READ errors being generated, the MaxOidCompFailures
     parameter (described above under the <a href="#devSnmpSetParam">devSnmpSetParam</a> IOC shell
     call) specifies how tolerant to be.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="gotcha_DiffVal"><b>Devices that return different data than requested</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Some Wiener/ISEG/MPOD units have been observed to do this, return a
     variable with the same OID that was requested but with data that
     comes from some other OID in the system. There is no good way for
     the module to protect itself against this, the best that can be
     done if you suspect this is happening is to carefully document the
     issue (making sure the problem is not, for example, due to a bug in
     this module! or due to a bad cable causing the variable value to truly
     drop in and out) and then seek support from the manufacturer.
     Wiener is said to have a firmware upgrade that (mostly) allieviates
     this.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>snmpwalk times-out or exits before returning complete variable listing</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Slow or busy SNMP hosts sometimes confound the NET-SNMP snmpwalk
     utility. Adjusting the timeout and retry-count arguments can be
     helpful. I find this set of options almost always works to retrieve
     the complete list, though it can take a longish while:</p>
     <pre>   snmpwalk -m ALL -Cc -r 4 -t 15 (followed by host/community/etc arguments afterward)</pre>
   <p>An example querying a Wiener/ISEG/MPOD would be:</p>
     <pre>   snmpwalk -m ALL -Cc -r 4 -t 15 -c public 192.168.54.62 crate</pre>
